# 11.1 Create two different process groups for separate collective communications exchange, starting from 8 processes and using MPI_Group_incl. Then perform an Allreduce to sum the ranks of those two independent groups and print the result.

# 11.2 Create a communicator which contains the prime ranks from MPI_COMM_WORLD (max 16 processes, unless ranks[] array is modified in the code). Use MPI_Group_incl and results in prime_group. Next, pass that group to MPI_Comm_create_group to create prime_comm. At the end, be careful to not use prime_comm on processes which donâ€™t have it, therefore one should check that the communicator is not MPI_COMM_NULL, which is returned from MPI_Comm_create_group on the ranks not included in ranks.
